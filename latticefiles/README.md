# Ground truth ground states
These directories contain Hamiltonians (in the form of `latfiles`) and ground truth ground state energies (computed either exactly, or using the Spin Glass Server, where appropriate).


There are three types:

 - `weakstrongcluster/`: Weak-strong cluster Hamiltonian (a single Hamiltonian)
 - `toroidal2d/ferro`: Various sized ferromagnetic Ising model instances.  One Hamiltonian per size
 - `toroidal2d/RND_J`: 100 instances per size of randomly-generated spin-glass instances, with energies calculated using the spin glass server
